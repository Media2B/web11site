                        <p><i>We are extremely proud to announce this year's keynote speaker: <a href="http://antonopoulos.com/">Mr. Andreas M. Antonopoulos</a>! Mr. Antonopoulos the author of the standard book on bitcoin technology, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Crypto-Currencies/dp/1449374042">Mastering Bitcoin</a>, and probably the best thinker in the field of cryptocurrencies and their possible impact. Backed by a deep technical understanding of blockchains he has provided the world with brilliant insights and clear explanations. Join us on the 25th of september to hear Mr. Antonopoulos share his vision on technologies that are relevant for building Web11.</i></p>
                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p>We, a community of technology enthusiasts, want to build a better web. One that improves everybody's lives by connecting everything to everything while still being trustworthy. A web that has the inability to fall into pitfalls of the past hardcoded into its DNA. We call this vision Web11, and we are not only talking about it, but actually building it. This conference is meant for the builders that share the same dream to meet, share and build.</p>
                        <h4>Some background...</h4>
                        <p>There is an unfathomable amount of untapped value stored in unconnected entities. Whether they are objects, humans, companies, organizations or countries. Connecting them to the internet enables them to participate in an emerging economic system, potentially reaching their own goal while increasing the value of the overall system. While most unconnected entities are at the small end of the scale (there is plenty of room at the bottom), larger entities such as humans also often have difficulty participating in economic transactions that enable them to realize their full potential.</p>

                        <p>Recent technological advances enable the connection of a fastly increasing number of entities and enable them to exchange value autonomously, transparently and securely. Combined with the fact that this ever more finer grained internet is increasingly permeating the physical world, its value and importance is growing at an exponential rate. A website being down might not be such a big deal, but access and control over your heart rate monitor is a different story. You want that to be as secure as possible and not in the hands of commercial companies. The stakes are getting higher.<p>

                        <p>Past technologies led to an internet that depends on an ever shrinking number of centralized, power-hungry authorities. This had a number of seriously negative consequences with regards to security, privacy, transparency, dependency, scalability and maintainability. It takes a decentralized network to tap into the collective value of the smallest connections and unleash its emergent power on large scales. Recent technological developments make this possible. Benefits that used to require central authorities are now achievable in peer to peer networks without relying on third parties. Decentralized trust, accountability, identification, allow for transactions that cannot be accommodated centrally because of privacy concerns, latency issues, large-volume but low-value or complex one-of-a-kind transactions, etc. The result is a (re)decentralized internet consisting of autonomous entities that can securely transact in a peer to peer fashion. That is what we call Web11.</p>

                        <p>For more insight please read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEtAJvD_Blvhc8xN-1JMNeijh_Z4YUdvdBDHh3Bpqnc/edit#">Web11 flyer</a> and the <a href="http://www.kunnis.org/">Kunnis manifesto</a>.</p>
                        <h1>Conference</h1>
                        <p>The Web11 conference is all about the engineering of Web11. It is a new kind of advanced technology conference where makers and their tools take center stage. There will be presentations, panel discussions, open sessions, papers, hands-on sessions, lively hallway debates and beer. Meetings about areas affected by the technical changes will serve as side-tracks. The main goal will be building the future, not just talking about it.</p>
                        <h1>Topics</h1>
                        Technologies required to build Web11 (and thus topics for the conference) are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>IoT</li>
                            <li>AI</li>
                            <li>Decentralization</li>
                            <li>Security</li>
                            <li>P2P technologies</li>
                            <li>Networking protocols</li>
                            <li>Blockchain</li>
                            <li>Contracts</li>
                            <li>Cryptocurrencies</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Every year we will highlight one or two areas that will be affected by the rise of Web11. This year the areas are Healthcare and Organizational structures. Participants from these affected areas will join the debate.</p>
                        <h1>Participants</h1>
                        <p>The diversity of both the subject and the set of involved technologies results in a very diverse set of participants. The single aspect in common is the fact that they all contribute to Web11 by writing software for some part of it. To give you an idea of the audience here is a provisional list of participants.</p>
